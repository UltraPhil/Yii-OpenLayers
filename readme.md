Yii-OpenLayers
=====

What is Yii-OpenLayers?
--------------
Yii-OpenLayers is an extension to include OpenLayers map, OOP-style, PHP, in your YII applications.

What I'm planning to support:
- Map
	- Layers
	- LonLat items
	- Markers
- OL Widget
- JS scripts to help interracting with the map.


Current Version 0.1 (2012-12-21 13:00)
--------------

First Commit !

It includes a working but raw version of a Yii Extension.

Working, out of the box:

- Maps
	- Layers
	- LonLat items
	- Markers
- OL Widget

Once again, this is a rough release. Ongoing versions will include tutorials, refinements, and
more functionalities.

The project contains an asset folder with the OpenLayers source file. The project is delivered
as is. The current version will always be guaranteed to work with the included version of OL.

Should you replace OpenLayers with an other version is at your discretion.
